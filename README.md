## Description:

Crude oil is a yellow-black naturally occurring liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, it
can be separated into various kinds of consumer fuels through the process of fractional distillation.
Crude oil is amongst the most important energy resources on earth right now. So far, it remains the worldâ€™s leading fuel, with
nearly one-third of global energy consumption. Petroleum products are also made of refined crude oil.
Encouraging usage of fossil fuels is getting highly unpopular as they're irrefutably responsible for global warming, and other
severe impacts on ecosystems.There are many irregularities associated with their pricing worldwide.
